QuantiModo-Sync
===============

An Android app that can extract data from other Android applications and send it to the QuantiModo website to be analyzed.

Note that your phone must be rooted for QuantiModo Sync to access the databases. 

Tracking apps that are currently supported include:
- Medhelper
- Sleep as Android
- SportsTracker
- MyFitnessCompanion
- MyFitnessPal
- Good Day Journal
- T2 Mood Tracker
- Accupedo
- Cardiograph
- How are you feeling?
- Zombies Run
- Medisafe
- Call Recorder
- Data Habit
- More to come!

If you want to add an app, you just need to make a converter for it. A converter transforms the data from a tracking app's database into a form that can be posted to the QuantiModo API. Email info@quantimo.do to find out more.
